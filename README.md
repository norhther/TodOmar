# TodOmar - Yet Another To-Do App
Welcome to TodOmar, the revolutionary app where you can do the most groundbreaking thing: write down tasks and check them off. Yes, just like every other to-do app, but this one is completely *free*.
This is a super-alpha app, future features will be added.

# Features
 - Add Tasks: Because remembering things is hard.
 - Mark Tasks as Complete: Feel accomplished for checking a box.
 - View Active and Completed Tasks: Categorized for your convenience (you’re welcome).
 - Due Dates: Optional, but why not add more pressure to your life?
 - Persistent Storage: Your tasks stay here even after you rage-quit the app.

# Why Use This App?
Good question. If you’re tired of paying $4.99/month to remember to buy milk, this might be your saving grace. Or just write it down on paper. Your call.
